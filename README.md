# Learn React by Building Netflix
I am an absolute beginner and stepped into it recently and already enjoying it. I have now basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JS and little bit React(know the basics atleast!) still learning and I know this journey is too long but thanks to **NEVER-GIVE-UP** attitude. I believe in **LEARNING BY DOING** So I created a git repository that helped me learn react by buiding **Netflix clone**. 
Soon I'll be sharing a complete blog to answer your - how, what and why of my journey of building this project and  will explain every line of code with as much as detailed explainations so an absoulte beginner can easily grasp the logic and don't feel frustrated and trust me you're gonna enjoy this!.

**Happy Learning**
